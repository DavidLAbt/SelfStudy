The codes are from GStreamer Application Development Manual (1.4.5). I retype the examples while studing GStreamer.


The file is named in the form of

 	ex<chapter_numb>_<sub_chapter_numb>.cpp
 

The usage is as follows:
 
 	// cd to the root directory
 	cd TestGStreamer
 	
 	// clean 
 	make clean
 	
 	// make the source code file
 	make ex4_1
 	
 	// run the example
 	./bin/ex4_1
